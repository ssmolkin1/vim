* Emacs
** Version control
I created a new github repo: https://github.com/ssmolkin1/emacs.d to version control my =init.el=. It will ignore everything except my snippets and my =init.el=. Need to delete =.emacs= from home directories so that it does not override =init.el=.
** Spelling
Emacs relies on external spell check for spelling:
- ispell (outdated)
- aspell (not maintained)
- hunspell (maintained, but maybe worse than aspell)

Both aspell and hunspell mask themselves as ispell for backwards compatibility.

Need to install dictionaries on top of the spell checker as well. These are also available in the Arch repos. E.g., =aspell-en=.

Flyspell and ispell in emacs should then work without any extra config. Need to enable flyspell manually or add hooks, though.

** LaTeX
First I installed auctex using use-packaged. For some reason, I have to set =:defer t= for this to work...
Then I installed texlive-core on my system.
=======

Press 'i' when checking a word to add it to your personal dictionary.
** LaTeX
Need the packages =texlive-core= and =texlive-latexextra= (if you don't get the second one, you will forever be installing sty files manually)
If you do install a .sty file manually, try to install it as a package via AUR
If using glossaries, need to use AUCTex to compile glossaries first (choose from the C-c C-c menu), then run latex. 
Use 'k' to kill the PDF View buffer after viewing, otherwise it could prevent overwriting the file.
